# WebRTC
WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication for video, voice, and data sharing. In a setup using Node.js and React.js, React handles the front-end interface and manages peer connections via the WebRTC API. Node.js acts as the signaling server, using Express and Socket.io to exchange connection data and facilitate real-time communication.
